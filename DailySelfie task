Objectives:
Create an application from scratch that periodically reminds the user to take a selfie - a picture of one's self taken from one's device. 
Over time the user will capture many selfies and thus will be able to see him or herself change over some period of time.

Requirement #1: If the user clicks on the camera icon on the ActionBar, the app will open up a picture-taking app already installed on the device. 
Requirement #2: If the user now snaps a picture and accepts it, the picture is returned to the DailySelfie app and then displayed in some way to the user along with other selfies the user may have already taken.
Requirement #3: If the user clicks on the small View, then a large view will open up, showing the selfie in a larger format.
Requirement #4: In particular, if the user exits the app and then reopens it, they should have access to all the selfies saved on their device. You may optionally include some way for the user to delete some or all of their selfies.
Requirement #5: Because the user wants to take selfies periodically over a long period of time, the app should create and set an Alarm that fires roughly once every two minutes. In a real app, this would most likely be set to a longer period, such as once per day. When one of these alarms fires, a notification area notification should be placed in the notification area.
